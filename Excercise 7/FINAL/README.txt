Contribution Log:

All group members worked on Exercise Sheet individually at first. 
We then discussed our approaches and solutions together, and agreed on a final submission based on the most accurate and well-documented results.

The individual contributions are as follows:

Task 1:
- Contributor: Elisa
- Details: Finding the PMF at time = 2, proving that the limit doesn't exist.

Task 2:
- Contributors: Mohamed
- Details: Proved the given Inequality

Task 3:
- Contributor: Federico
- Details: 
	- solving for the marginal x_t , deriving the SDE and computing meu_s and sigma_s 
	- Writing the Euler–Maruyama discretization for the reverse SDE with step Δs under an exact score.	
	- Implementing exact and Euler–Maruyama sampling in Python for 1 000 samples.


Notes:
- All solutions were discussed and validated as a group before finalizing this submission.
- All Python code was written using Python 3.x and contains comments explaining the functionality.
- This submission follows all formatting and content requirements as outlined in the official assignment submission guidelines.
