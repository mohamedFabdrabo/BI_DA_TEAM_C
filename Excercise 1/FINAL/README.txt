- Ilia

Contribution Log:

All group members worked on Exercise Sheet 0 individually at first. We then discussed our approaches and solutions together, and agreed on a final submission based on the most accurate and well-documented results.

The individual contributions are as follows:

Task 1:
- Contributor: Federico
- Details: The analytical solution for the least squares line is provided by Federico. The final result is included in the file Sheet00_GroupC.pdf.

Task 2:
- Contributors: Elisa and Mohamed
- Details: The implementation of the Euler method, plotting, and error analysis for the given differential equation are done collaboratively by Elisa and Mohamed. These solutions are located in the first main part of the script Sheet00_GroupC.py.

Task 3:
- Contributor: Ilia
- Details: The implementation of the Euler method for the Lorenz system and the corresponding 3D trajectory plot are provided by Ilia. This solution forms the second and final part of the script Sheet00_GroupC.py.

Notes:
- All solutions were discussed and validated as a group before finalizing this submission.
- All Python code was written using Python 3.x and contains comments explaining the functionality.
- This submission follows all formatting and content requirements as outlined in the official assignment submission guidelines.
