# README - Exercise Sheet 0 - Group C

## Group Members:
- Federico
- Elisa
- Mohamed
- Ilia

## Contribution Log:

All group members worked on Exercise Sheet 0 individually at first. We then discussed our approaches and solutions together, and agreed on a final submission based on the most accurate and well-documented results.

The individual contributions are as follows:

### Task 1:
- **Contributor:** Federico
- **Details:** The analytical solution for the least squares line is provided by Federico. The final result is included in the `Sheet00_GroupC.pdf` file.

### Task 2:
- **Contributors:** Elisa and Mohamed
- **Details:** The implementation of the Euler method, plotting, and error analysis for the given ODE are done collaboratively by Elisa and Mohamed. These solutions are located in the **first main part** of the `Sheet00_GroupC.py` script.

### Task 3:
- **Contributor:** Ilia
- **Details:** The implementation of the Euler method for the Lorenz system and the corresponding 3D plot are provided by Ilia. This solution forms the **second and final part** of the `Sheet00_GroupC.py` script.

## Notes:
- All solutions were discussed and validated as a group before finalizing this submission.
- All code was written using Python 3.x and includes explanatory comments.
- The submission follows the formatting and content requirements stated in the official assignment guidelines.
