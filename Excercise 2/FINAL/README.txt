Contribution Log:

All group members worked on Exercise Sheet 1 individually at first. We then discussed our approaches and solutions together, and agreed on a final submission based on the most accurate and well-documented results.

The individual contributions are as follows:

Task 1:
- Contributor: Federico
- Details: Implemented the forward Euler integration of the Lorenz‑63 system and stored the reference trajectory at intervals of Δtout = 0.05 over t ∈ [0,200]. Produced and verified the 3D attractor plot.

Task 2:
- Contributors: Ilia
- Details: Generated noisy observations of the x‑component from the trajectory saved in Task 1. Implemented the observation process with 20-sample Gaussian noise averaging and validated the output.

Task 3:
- Contributor: Elisa and Mohamed
- Details: Applied linear extrapolation forecasts to the observations from Task 2 for one‑ and three‑step ahead horizons. Computed time‑averaged RMSE for both forecast intervals and plotted sample comparisons.

Notes:
- All solutions were discussed and validated as a group before finalizing this submission.
- All Python code was written using Python 3.x and contains comments explaining the functionality.
- This submission follows all formatting and content requirements as outlined in the official assignment submission guidelines.
