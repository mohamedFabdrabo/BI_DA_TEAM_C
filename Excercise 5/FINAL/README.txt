Group Members:
- Federico
- Elisa
- Mohamed

Contribution Log:

All group members worked on Exercise Sheet individually at first. 
We then discussed our approaches and solutions together, and agreed on a final submission based on the most accurate and well-documented results.

The individual contributions are as follows:

Task 1:
- Contributor: Federico
- Details: Determine the ANOVA Decomposition and compute the associated variances.

Task 2:
- Contributors: Elisa
- Details: analytically computed the expectation and variance of the given function and then Wrote a python script to estimate the expectation using the Monte Carlo Method.

Task 3:
- Contributor: Elisa and Mohamed
- Details: 
	- Calculated the quadrature weight given the quadrature nodes. 
	- Proved that the quadrature rule integrates all polynomial of degree up to 3.
	- implemented the quadrature rule in python and used it to approximate the given function  


Notes:
- All solutions were discussed and validated as a group before finalizing this submission.
- All Python code was written using Python 3.x and contains comments explaining the functionality.
- This submission follows all formatting and content requirements as outlined in the official assignment submission guidelines.
