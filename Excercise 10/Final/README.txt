README - Exercise Sheet 8 - Group C

Group Members:

Contribution Log:

All group members worked on Exercise Sheet individually at first. 
We then discussed our approaches and solutions together, and agreed on a final submission based on the most accurate and well-documented results.

The individual contributions are as follows:

Task 1:
Contributor: Elisa

Details: 
- Simulated particle trajectories from the given SDE using the Euler–Maruyama method up to final time T = 2.0.
- Computed and plotted histograms of the particle distributions at time points t ∈ {0.5, 1.0, 2.0}.
- Compared the empirical distributions to the analytical solutions (known mean and variance) at each time.
- Discussed the convergence behavior and deviation between empirical and analytical distributions across time points, highlighting improved agreement as time progressed.

		   
Task 2
Contributors: Mohamed & Federico
Details:
- Derived the equivalence between equations (4.45) and (4.44) using the definition of the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) from equation (4.43) in the book.
- Proved that the CRPS is a proper scoring rule by following its formal definition and properties.
- Computed the empirical CRPS for the well-specified and misspecified forecast ensembles from Problem 2.
- Analyzed and discussed how the CRPS values support the conclusions drawn from the rank histogram comparisons, with lower CRPS indicating better-calibrated forecasts.

Notes:
- All solutions were discussed and validated as a group before finalizing this submission.
- All Python code was written using Python 3.x and contains comments explaining the functionality.
- This submission follows all formatting and content requirements as outlined in the official assignment submission guidelines.
